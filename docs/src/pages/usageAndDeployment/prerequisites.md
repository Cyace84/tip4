# Prerequisites

## Packages

In order to perform the operations mentioned in this documentation using  [`everscale-inpage-provider`](https://provider-docs.broxus.com/) , the target contracts artifacts, including the contract tvc and code, are required. These artifacts can be obtained using the `locklift build` command, which generates the necessary files which we can provide them by simply copying and pasting the these required files from the build folder as we generated them earlier in [Locklift Config Setup](../gettingStarted/lockliftConfigSetup.md#step-3-build-the-artifacts).

::: tip

in the everscale-inpage-provider code samples provided in next sections, the contract artifacts are imported from build folder, we must copy the previously mentioned build folder into the script directory of our project.

:::


The necessary npm packages are as follows:

-  `everscale-inpage-provider`
-  `everscale-standalone-client`

::: info
Here is the propose of using the mentioned packages in our scripts:

- `everscale-inpage-provider` is used to interact with blockchain in Dapps.
- `everscale-standalone-client` Facilitates usage of the Accounts when interacting with them.
:::


To install these packages, run the following command in your shell:

```` shell
npm install --save-dev everscale-inpage-provider everscale-standalone-client
````

::: warning
The following steps are only required when building Dapps and using decentralized wallets. If you are using **locklift** to make transactions, you can skip this step.
:::

## Provider

The  `everscale-inpage-provider`  is used as a provider for TVM based blockchains such as [Venom](https://venom.foundation/) and [Everscale](https://everscale.network/). Follow the steps below to initialize and use  `everscale-inpage-provider`  in your scripts.

You can also refer to the [everscale-inpage-provider Docs](https://provider-docs.broxus.com/guides/deploy.html#deploy-a-contract) for detailed instructions.

### Step 1: Create the module

Create a file named `useProvider.ts`.

### Step 2: Add Scripts

Add the following script to the file you just made:


````typescript
import { ProviderRpcClient, Address } from "everscale-inpage-provider";

/**
 * Fetches the data about the EVER Wallet
 * @returns Either the Tvm provider, Tvm wallet address or undefined
 */
export async function useProviderInfo(): Promise<[ProviderRpcClient, Address]> {
  try {
    // Initialize the provider
    const provider: ProviderRpcClient = new ProviderRpcClient();

    // Make sure the provider is initialized.
    await provider.ensureInitialized();

    // Request permissions from the user to execute API
    await provider.requestPermissions({
      permissions: ["basic", "accountInteraction"],
    });

    // setting the ever sender address
    const providerAddress: Address = (await provider.getProviderState())
      .permissions.accountInteraction!.address;

    return [provider, providerAddress];
  } catch (e: any) {
    throw new Error(e.message);
  }
}

````

From now we can use the provider object and the provider address in our scripts by just simply importing and initiating this function.
