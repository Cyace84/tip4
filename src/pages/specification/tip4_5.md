# TIP-4_5 (Non-Fungible Licensing)

Requires: [TIP-4.1](./tip4_1.md)\
Requires: [TIP-6.1](./tip6.md)
# Overview

The NFT License standard is a set of functions for retrieving license information's. This interface allows external callers to access the license URI and the license name associated with a specific entity. The preferred but not mandatory method of storing license links is using IPFS. A collection of NFT licenses can be obtained via a link.

## Motivation

This standard was developed based on the previous version of the "CantBeEvil" standard. The new "NFT Licensing" standard offers you more freedom and flexibility in using licenses for your NFT tokens, allowing you to choose any license that reflects your vision and protects your rights, provided that a link to it is provided.
